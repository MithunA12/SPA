Prior to running the code do the following:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder flask_server.
2. Run the app.py python script with: 
### python app.py
3. Go through ViewerScreen.js, PSGViewer,js, and Home.js, and replace "http://192.168.1.24:5000" with your own IP address, which can be found in the terminal for the app.py script. Make sure the format is the same as the above example.
4. Once you finish the replacement, in a new terminal navigate to the folder "spa_app".

In the "spa_app" directory, you can run in a separate terminal:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
